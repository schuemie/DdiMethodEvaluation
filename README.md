Evaluating methods to detect drug-drug interactions
===================================================

Some code to evaluate approached to detecting DDIs in observational data using the CDM.

Current approach uses the self-controlled case series (SCCS) design with an interaction term, so implying a multiplicative model. From this, we derive a DDI effect estimate using an additive effect.
